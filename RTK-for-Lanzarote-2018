Reach RTK procedures for Lanzarote

Reach Rover, Reach Base, Reach Mini New, Reach Mini Old

Pre survey check
- make sure batteries are fully charged
- check and make sure that the base can connect to the correct NTRIP server
- mobile phone connection, so that the Base can connect to the strip server
- tripod, tape measure and survey pole ready
- check rover and base software, reach view updates needed ?
- for the mini's charged USB power bank, cables and round disks (multi path) for the antenna

Survey setting

FIRST properly setup the tripod for the Base, measure height, remember the 65mm needs to be added to the height
THEN power on the BASE and wait for it to start connect to the NTRIP server via phone. 

Try to:
- get a good fix with mobile phone connections
- make sure that you are logging

DO NOT TOUCH OR MOVE THE BASE NOW !!

Next setup the rover on the survey pole. 
Accurately measure the height.

Switch on the Rover making sure that it does not connect to the same plan hotspot as the BASE

Wait and make sure that it is getting a LORA feed from the Base. Check that you have proper line of sight.

Setup the survey in reach view with proper antenna heights. Use auto logging fix and float to test the first point. Finally make sure that you are logging data.

NOW go and layout the drone target GCPs along with the LIDAR targets.

Survey the points, remember:
- try to get fixes
- hold the pole straight
- return to one or two survey points to double check accuracy.


Post survey

- connect and download all data

PUT ROVER AND BASE IN SEPARATE FOLDERS; DO NOT MIX THESE UP !!

Do quick check of data
Do quick post processing:

  convert the base and rover ublox to rihex format
  use rtkprocess to with rover obs and nav plus base obs
  use rtkplot to check results

NOTE WGS 84 Ellipsoidal heights are not ORTHOMETRIC
